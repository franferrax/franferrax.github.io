    \section*{About} \label{sec:about}
    I am a senior engineer with more than 6 years of experience in software development and application security.
    I hold a technical role in the development of \emph{Core Impact},
    a leading penetration testing and offensive security product by \emph{HelpSystems}.
    I write code in \python{} and \cc{}/\cpp{} on a daily basis.
    As a professional, I am interested in low-level programing,
    network protocols, cryptography, and security vulnerabilities,
    including analysis and exploitation for testing purposes.

    \section*{Work Experience} \label{sec:experience}

    \subsection*{HelpSystems (ex Core Security)  \mysep Argentina \mysep 2015 --- Present} \label{subsec:job1}
    I have been working at this company for more than 6 years, achieving 3 promotions.
    Our team has shipped the last 11 releases of \emph{Core Impact}.

    \subsubsection*{Sr Developer (Core Security - Help Systems) \mysep Jun 2019 --- Present}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Being the most experienced engineer in the team, I usually
        provide guidance to new hires with the onboarding and ramp-up process
        \item Holding a technical leadership role, I became
        a dependable point of reference for other members and teams
        when they need to discuss architectural changes
        or dive into the implementation details of some areas of the product
        \item Comprehending the importance of the product quality and stability,
        I am also involved in maintaining the product testing framework
        and its associated testing lab composed by thousands of virtual machines
        \item I am very active in the team chat
        and often happy to answer any question,
        I also take an important role in the meetings
        when discussing how to address new requirements
        \item In late 2020 / early 2021: led a major upgrade of
        our modified version of the \lib{OpenSSL} library (v1.0.1 $\rightarrow$ v1.1.1),
        from the planning phase to the final integration
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This upgrade also extended to our modified version of the \lib{pyOpenSSL} \python{} bindings,
            whose upstream project had evolved from a \emph{CPython} extension to a pure-\python{} library
            relying on the \lib{cryptography} library \lib{cffi} bindings
            (that implied porting our patches to expose the extended APIs by our \lib{OpenSSL} modifications)
            \item As part of this work, several \python{} libraries ended up integrated
            into our codebase, requiring changes in our non-standard \python{} build system
            (due to the way in which the interpreter is customized and embedded in the product)
            \item In the end, we finished with a renewed cryptography stack,
            removing legacy bindings and with a simpler mechanism to integrate third party libraries
        \end{itemize}
        \item In 2019: actively worked in the refinement of the requirements
        for a highly prioritized update of our licensing mechanism,
        coordinating infrastructure changes across multiple teams
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Helped to envision the shortest path to achieve our goal,
            and played a key role conveying that idea
            and convincing the team that it would work
            \item As part of the tasks, took responsibility for modifying
            a very legacy copy protection mechanism written in (old) \cpp{},
            which represented the main source of uncertainty
            regarding the feasibility of the requirement
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{Ssr Developer (Core Security) \mysep May 2017 --- May 2019}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rewrote a \emph{phishing} webpage cloning module to change its approach,
        by mounting a \emph{man-in-the-middle reverse proxy}
        (also took part in the previous design/analysis)
        \item Worked in pairs for an urgent security patch
        to the updates channel of our product,
        dealing with completely unknown code
        and a legacy unmaintained cloud infrastructure;
        we refactored \python{} code to remove duplicated logic,
        added tests and shipped the fix in the expected time
        \item Started to work in multiple parts of the product,
        fixing minor issues in components that I was less used to
        (such as \emph{JavaScript} graphical user interface code),
        and developing tests which required specific \emph{Linux} server configurations
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{Jr Developer (Core Security) \mysep Jan 2016 --- Apr 2017}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collaborated extending a generic mechanism
        to remotely execute library functions on \emph{Linux} agents,
        involving \emph{dynamically linked libraries}, function resolving mechanisms,
        the \emph{System V Application Binary Interface} and its \emph{calling conventions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This task required writing \emph{x86-64 inline assembly} in \cc{}
            and assembled instructions as raw bytes in \python{},
            as well as remotely debugging our agent without symbols
            (since it basically consists of \emph{position independent} stripped \cc{} code)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Performed medium-scale \cc{} and \python{} refactors to reorganize some APIs
        and reduce boilerplate code
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{Trainee/Intern Developer (Core Security) \mysep Jan 2015 --- Dec 2015}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collaborated extending the post-exploitation infrastructure of \emph{Android} agents (in \cc{})
        \item Implemented \cc{} structures member alignment through padding bytes,
        in an in-house \python{} library interfacing with low-level APIs
        (also wrote the corresponding test suite, which included a testing \emph{dynamically linked library})
    \end{itemize}


    \section*{Education} \label{sec:education}

    \subsection*{Electronics Engineer \mysep Universidad de Buenos Aires \mysep 2010 --- Present} \label{subsec:edu1}
    I started the \emph{Electronics Engineer} career in 2010.
    I began my first work internship in 2015 (recommended by one of my programming teachers),
    and realized that my professional career would evolve towards the computing area.
    I decided to continue with \emph{Electronics Engineer}
    since I like low-level programming, information security, and enjoy learning about hardware.
    I reduced the academic time to focus on my professional development, and since there
    I continued my studies in background.
    I have completed approximately 50\% of the career up to this point.
